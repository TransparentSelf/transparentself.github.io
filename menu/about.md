I want to keep this site as "lean" as possible, because the "meat" is the content. And the contents are the following:

# Journal
This is intended to be my journal. A platform to bring my meaningful thoughts and feelings to life.

# Goals
This is intended to be my aim. I can really easily lose sight of the bigger picture. This is the honing of my focus.
