...so you think Life have robbed you of meaning. You hate the job you do and it seems like that there is no way out...

But this is a lie! Because if you look closely enough, meaning is everywhere... And you can always *flip the script* so it's to your advantage. 

You can race against yourself on the job, find a worthy ally, and a meaningful aim even in Hell, so may reach yet again Heaven.
