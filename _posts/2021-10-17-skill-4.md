Okay you caught me. This is not a skill. It's a competency rather. A perspective. A way to organize and structure your activites.

I have studied many of those "waterfall" models. Those models where the road is a definitive one, with given steps. 

In startup world you still have to do a complete market research, provide a meticulous business model and financial plan to be able to qualify for an initial round of investment.

It's so outdated.

I am not saying that the above has no value. I am saying that it's just to early to tell what the product tick.

I think this was in part why I fell in love with UX design. Because it seems for me that agility is built into the very structure of the UX process. You research, create, analyze and iterate. 

Well I gotta stay I have trouble when 

and also feel already a bit kind of ashamed of the product we are planning with my business partner. 

But as said "prioritize for speed".
