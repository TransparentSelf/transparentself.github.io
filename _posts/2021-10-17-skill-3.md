# Design

Beauty always marveled me. 

And it's so hard to choose sometimes between usability and beauty. Functionality and design. But honestly, unless you have infinite money you have to do just that eventually... And that is really hard for me because I really enjoy a great looking product! For sure I am even guilty of buying a great looking product even though the functionality of the product was really bad. Unfortunately that bad functionality will eventually gets so frustrating that I just stop using the product. So the big lesson for me here is to put functionality before beauty when the road has to go in one way or the other. 

Check out some of my designs below.
