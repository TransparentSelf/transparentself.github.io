Okay you caught me. This is not a skill. It's a *competency* rather. A perspective. A way to organize and structure your actions.

I have studied many of those "waterfall" models. Those models where the road is a definitive one, with given steps and a known outcome. In my opinion this is rarely the case. 

In today's startup's world you still have to do "complete" market research, provide a meticulous business model and financial plan to be able to qualify for an initial round of investment.

This is just so outdated.

I am not saying that none of the above has value. There is certainly value for all those activities I am just saying that it's *maybe* too early to tell what makes a business tick *if* you haven't even tested your product...

I think this was in part why I fell in love with UX design. Because it seems for me that **agility is built into the very structure of the UX process**. You research, create, analyze, iterate and repeat.

As Reid Hoffman said "prioritize speed over efficiency during a period of uncertainty".
