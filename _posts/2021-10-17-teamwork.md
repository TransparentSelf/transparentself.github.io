Collaboration is one the 4 key competencies of the 21st century. I know you heard this so many times... It became boring. It became dull. But I can ensure you that is absolutely a must especially when it comes to ux design.

We can not avoid the fact that people thrive in great teams! And thriving people makes great product!

So that begs the question...

What makes a great team? Great teamplayers!
