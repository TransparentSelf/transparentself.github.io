Collaboration is one the 4 key competencies of the 21st century. I know you heard this so many times... It became boring. It became dull. But I can ensure you that is absolutely a must especially when it comes to ux design.

We can not avoid the fact that people thrive in great teams! And thriving people makes great product!

So that begs the question...

What makes a great team? Great teamplayers!

What makes a great teamplayer?

Aron. Focus please! You are running around... What is your responsibility here? What makes *you* a great teamplayer?

Okay, I think the important bit for me here is to see and accept that **the team's good is greater then the individual's good**. I am afraid I can't say that always live by that, but I can say that I do strive to be better company every day.
