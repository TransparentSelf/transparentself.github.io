Alright, alright, alright. Sorry. I know... Agile is not a *skill*. It's more like a knowledge.

I think all the rest of the skills are fail to operate efficiently unless they are applied in the right *context*.

I believe you can not avoid the fact, that you as a UX/UI professional have to know the Zeitgeist.

There is a great TED talk on why startups fail. **Spoiler alert** it's timing. 

Maybe I am using the startup example's a bit too much, but in my opinion this is a great analogy for product design.

You have to be able to listen to the trends closely but also to act on them so to say *closely*. You certainly have to innovate. But there is a thing called too much innovation... 

If you change every single icon in the header for the name of usability that will for sure cause tremendous headache to your costumers. Not to mention the great deal of time that it takes to learn the new icon's meaning. And remember it's a cruel world out there. Unless you are Google (maybe even then), you have fierce competition 
and you if not you for sure will have. And if they don't like your product they may tap away in the blink of an eye. 

I think **those people and products win that can consciously and steadily innovate** in these extremely interesting but on the other hand volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous times we are having.
