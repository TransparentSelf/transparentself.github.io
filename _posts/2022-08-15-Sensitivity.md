I have always thought deep down that Sensitive people see the world wrong. This was not an explicit thought. It just kinda was lurking deep down in the dark. I myself am a reasonably happy optimist with a very low Sensitivity. And so when I see the world, I see it as a place of limitless potential and a grand place to adventure. But my other half is very-very Sensitive. And so she sees the world as a place where one needs to find comfort, safety and stability. And these points contradict each other, and so me, the optimist, defaults into thinking if I am right, the other one must be wrong. Again, these are not explicit thoughts; these are scripts running in the background. But now I realize, after a year of being out in the dark places, without a job and purpose that being safe sometimes is the right call.
