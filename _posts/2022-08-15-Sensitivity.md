I have always thought deep down that Sensitive people see the world wrong. 

This was not an explicit thought. It was just kind of lurking deep down in the dark. 

I myself am a reasonably happy optimist who is very low in Sensitivity. And so when I see the world, I see it as a place of limitless potential and a grand place for adventure. 

But my other half is very-very Sensitive. And so she sees the world as a place where one needs to find comfort, safety and stability. 

And these points contradict each other, and so me, the optimist, defaults into thinking: "if I am right, the other one must be wrong". 

Again, these are not explicit thoughts; these are *scripts* running in the background. But now I realize, after a year of being out in the Dark places, sometimes without a job and sometimes without a purpose, that **being safe sometimes is the right call**.
