> "If we have our own why in life, we shall get along with almost any how..." - Nietzsche

It's really frightening how easy it is to lose our sense of why. 

It happened to me just like that. One day I was walking on the Road and I had hopes and dreams and whatnot... 

But in the corner some heavy lessons were creeping, and after a couple of slaps from good ol' life, I had just lost sight of the future. 

<br>

I think I am a very lucky guy. My mother had a paper from a doctor saying that she *could not* have children. 

Lucky for me, she did not buy that... She decided when she got that paper that she would have three children. 

And so she tore that paper into pieces, and here I am, the third child of my mother.

<br>

But even after that and a good 20 years or so, I was not prepared for setbacks. 

And so I focused on my pain and misery, and I had lost touch with meaning...
