â€º If we have our own why in life, we shall get along with almost any how. Man does not strive for pleasure; only the Englishman does. - Nietzsche

It's really frightening how easy it is to lose our sense of why. 

It happened to me just like that. One day I was walking on the Road and I had hopes and dreams, 

and after a couple of slaps from good ol' life, I have just lost my faith in the future. 

It happened to me just like that. One day I was walking on the Road and I had hopes and dreams, and after a couple of slaps from good ol' life I have just lost my faith in the future. 

I think I am a very lucky guy. My mother had a paper from a doctor saying that she *could not* have children. 

Lucky for me, she did not buy that... She decided when she got that paper that she would have three children. 

And so she tore that paper into pieces, and here I am, the third child of my mother.

What I was not ready for after so many successful rounds were setbacks. 

I was so focused on my misery that I had lost touch with meaning. 

*Why do I do, what I do?*

*What's the purpose of it?* 

*What is the bigger picture?*
