...but then sometimes. Life robs you of meaning. You hate the job you do and it seems like that there is no way out of the situation...

But that is a lie! Because if you look closely enough, meaning is everywhere... And you can always *flip the script* so it's to your advantage. 

You can race against yourself on the job, find a worthy ally, and a meaningful aim even in hell...
