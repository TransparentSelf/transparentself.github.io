The two side of same coin. Although such big fields that they would deserve a category of their own. But for the sake of time and simplicity and to provide an overarching structure let's just put them together.

I think you can not underestimate the power of a great research.

Although you might overestimate the importance of analyzing even the last bit of information. Because let's be honest there is too much research and frankly I am guilty of it. 

For instance if you check out my [medium article](https://medium.com/@aron.peter.kovacs/an-honest-guide-to-website-design-after-visiting-5-000-european-management-consulting-websites-4170ef208786) on website design you may find that researching thousands of websites is bit too much... Although it does make an excellent title! 'An Honest Guide to Website Design after Visiting 5000 European Management Consulting Websites'.

Anyhow, I was part of a research and development effort where we created the Thod.app. A blended learning focused LMS with gamified features. I was heavily involved in the market research (functionality, business model, pricing etc.) and also did a research on the gamification of the back-then current LMS products. The bit that I learned here (other than gamification is awesome) is that many of the initial questions might be answered through various research activities and you may not necessarily have to ask or test your costumers to get closer to what they want.
