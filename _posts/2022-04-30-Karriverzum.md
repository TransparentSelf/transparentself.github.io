> "A compass in the world of work"

# Executive Summary
A web platform for general IT career planning currently under development. Our goal (for now) is to provide a live carrer map for university students and young professionals where they can plan ahead their future in the world of IT.

# Core Problem
One of our founders Aron is just going through his 3rd big career shift. He is 27 years old. This maybe an extreme case but nonetheless this rapid career changing is now becoming more real then ever. Aron was planning to grow into product development and so UX Design certainly seemed a great place to start. But what is indeed UX Design? And where should an individual begin his journey with that? This question may very well be harder then it initially seems. The field of UX Design is certainly a new (and vast) place and there is a myriad of opportunities to start with. Should one work on information architecture, UI Design, or should one become a UX expert, working solely with analytics? These were hard questions our founder had to answer. And the search for the answer was long and painful, full with highly contextual advice and outdated views of the world. There has to be a better way for one to plan smartly one of the most important aspect of one's life: work.  

# Solution
The core problem sparked the Aron and Mark's interest and they begin to work on a solution which would enable to plan one's course of work in short and mid term. How can I get into a different IT career road as the one I am currently on? How can I get into the IT job of my dreams if I am currently doing IT x? How can I smartly plan ahead my future and escape the IT path that I am currently on if it's dying? These questions has fused us to be a "A compass in the world of work".

# Initial Research
The initial research has proved that there is a need for our solution. There are currently platforms, individuals and companies who serve the career councellor role but none of these provide you with a view on the current IT market conditions in terms of a transparent future planning.

# Market Research
The market research has strengthened our previous view. There is a strong need for transparent future planning and not just in IT... As a secondary school director in one of our expert interviews had stated: "We [teachers] are hesitant to give advice for young folks. The work they will do maybe don't even exist today so what can we say in that?". This is sums up the fast changing market conditions.

## Secondary Research
For our secondary research the best research contents are from the US and western EU. These may not be relevant for Hungary where we wish to enter the market, however the research has proved our point that concern young generation has is not exclusive to Hungary.

## User Interviews
When we asked university students - whom turned out to be our main target group - an overwhelming amount of them said they are unsure what they will do once they have finished studying.

## Expert Interviews
Most of the experts confirmed that there is a strong need for career advice and planning. However some has also raised their concern. One expert particulally - let's call him B cause he wished to stay anonim - has told us there seems to be a great need for career counselling however young folks (university students, high school students and young professionals) do not wish to pay the price for it. B has started a B2C career counselling business (he is a successful business trainer himself), but this hasn't turned out to be a fruitful business. I believe this really encapsulates that there is a huge gap between the generations and this seemingly empty "ocean" (in Hungary there is a couple of successful career counselling experts but compared to the our expected user size these businesses are rather small) of traditional brick and mortar business has a hidden a gem underneath.

# Initial Test
We set out to build a pretotype, to test our assumptions.

## Sketches

## Design and Branding
The first two touch points were for branding was the skill development in Diablo II:

and a game where a spark shows the way in the dark:

## Pretotype

## Testing
We tested the pretotype with a couple of IT student's and Levente one of the student's currently doing his Msc. in computer programming has liked the idea (and the challenge of gathering the career and job data) so much that he joined on board to develop our first API to gather data from LinkedIn.

# Product Development
Currently working on it.
