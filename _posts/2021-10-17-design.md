Beauty always marveled me. 

And it's so hard to choose sometimes between usability and beauty. Functionality and design. But honestly, unless you have infinite money you have to do just that eventually... And that is really hard for me because I really enjoy a great looking product! For sure I was plenty of times guilty of buying a great looking product even when the underlying functionality was really bad. I am just a sucker for great design. Unfortunately a bad functionality will eventually gets so frustrating that I just stop using the product. So much for design... So the big lesson for me here is when you have to decide choose functionality over beauty. 

Like this CV I made. 

![CV1](/assets/img/CV1.png)

It looked just *perfect* with the regular font size set to 9pt. But then it was impossible to read it... So I needed to amp up the letters a bit which then just ate up so much space... Ohh the struggle...  But what would you do, if you would see a CV, and you wouldn't be able to read it *in an instance*? Well if I know the CV is yours I would for sure zoom just zoom in it. But if I don't know you, and I have another 10 CV to choose from... Well, I am not so sure.

Anyhow since we are here which design would you prefer? I am curious. Please, if we meet next time, do tell me! ☺️
