Beauty always marveled me. 

And it's so hard to choose sometimes between usability and beauty. Functionality and design. But honestly, unless you have infinite money you have to do just that eventually... And that is really hard for me because I really enjoy a great looking product! For sure I was plenty of times guilty of buying a great looking product even when the underlying functionality was really bad. I am just a sucker for great design. Unfortunately a bad functionality will eventually gets so frustrating that I just stop using the product. So much for design... So the big lesson for me here is when you have to decide choose functionality over beauty. 

Anyhow which Design you prefer? I am curious. Please, if we meet next time, do tell me! ☺️
