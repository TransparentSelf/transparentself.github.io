Beauty always marveled me. 

And it's so hard to choose sometimes between usability and beauty. Between functionality and design. But honestly, unless you have infinite money you have to do just that eventually... And that is really hard for me because I am just a sucker for a great look... Unfortunately a bad functionality will eventually gets so frustrating that I just stop using the product. So much for design... 

**So the big lesson for me here is when you have to decide choose functionality over beauty.**

Like this CV I made. 

![CV0](/assets/img/CV0.png)

It looked just *perfect* with the regular font size set to 9pt. But then it was impossible to read it... So I needed to amp up the letters a bit which then just ate up so much space... Ohh the struggle...  But what would you do, if you would see a CV, and you wouldn't be able to read it *in an instance*? Well if I know that CV is yours I would *for sure* just zoom in it. But if I wouldn't know you, and I would have another 10 CV sitting next to me... Well, I am not so sure.
