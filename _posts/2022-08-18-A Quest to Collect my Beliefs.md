If I were to collect my Beliefs, the guiding propositions about the universe that I believe to be true, I would start with this; 

> "No matter what you do, you can do it."

I know, I know such a cliche... 

But it is also what coaches shout at their coachee when it comes to the very last rep.

And I have this internal coach, poking at me energetically: "You will do this."

Thanks Mom.
