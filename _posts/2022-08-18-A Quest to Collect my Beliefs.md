If I would to collect my Beliefs, the guiding principles that I run on. The *scripts* shaping my perception, I would start with this; 

› "You can do it."

I know, such a cliche... It is on most of the T-shirts and corny taglines. 

But it is also what coaches shout at their coachee on the very last rep. When maybe they themselves would not even try to go for it.

And I have this internal coach, shouting at me energetically: "You will do this."

Thanks mom.
