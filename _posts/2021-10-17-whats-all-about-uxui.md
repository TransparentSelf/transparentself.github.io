Hi, my name is Aron. This is my minimalist UX/UI "portfolio" designed to lend me a dreamjob in UX design. The purpose of the whole page is to provide you with a simple, clean, content-focused "portfolio" for an entry level UX/UI position. But before we do that you might be asking yourself. 

## Why UX design?

Why the urge is to lend a job in UX design? I believe it encompasses all the different aspects I love. People and Systems. Costumer-centeredness and Technology. Design and Usability just to name a few...

## Why you should hire me?

Because I am an extremely motivated young professional eager find my niche, grow and give value to the greater community.

## What about the "portfolio"?

And so why am I keep putting the portfolio in ""? Okay this is not strictly a portfolio. It's more like a showcase of skills, knowledge and understanding I had amassed in my short years as a professional. This is to provide you with a glimpse of my understanding linked to the field of UX design.  

## If not a portfolio, then what?

Skills! Or rather, 5 key competencies that stand out for me, when it comes to UX design. And these 5 skills are, not in a particular order:
- [Research and Analytics](https://aronuxui.github.io/research-and-analytics)
- [Teamwork](https://aronuxui.github.io/teamwork)
- [Design](https://aronuxui.github.io/design)
- [Agile](https://aronuxui.github.io/agile)
- [Understanding Current Trends](https://aronuxui.github.io/understanding-trends)

## So what?

Well, in the following 5 short and crisp posts I will share with you my connection to the above areas of expertise... I am not saying that I am an expert in any of those areas. This is just to share with you where I am on the journey regarding those areas. Also I am afraid I can be quite preachy so if you might feel overwhelmed then I apologize for that... I am doing that with a good hope that we all learn something today...
