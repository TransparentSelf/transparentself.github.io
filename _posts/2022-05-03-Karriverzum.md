# Executive Summary
A web platform for general IT career planning currently under development. Our first big hairy audacious goal is to provide **a live career map for IT university students and young IT professionals** where they can plan ahead their future in the world of IT.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

# Core Problem
One of our founder Aron is just going through his 3rd big career shift at the moment. He is 27 years old. This maybe an extreme case but nonetheless this rapid career change is now more prevalent then ever. Aron was planning to leave human resources and start a career in product design. To begin with that ux design certainly seemed a great place to start. *But what is indeed UX Design? And where should an individual begin his journey with that?* Googling these questions only get you so far. The field of UX Design is not just new, but also a vast place with myriad of opportunities. *Should one work on information architecture? Or should one do UI Design? Or maybe should one become a UX expert, working solely with analytics?* These were some of the questions our founder had to answer. And the search for answers is a rocky road filled with highly contextual advices and blurry trajectories. There has to be a better way to plan smartly one of the most important aspect of one's life: work.

#  

# Solution
The core problem sparked Aron and Mark's interest and they begin to work on a solution which would enable to plan one's course of work in short and mid term. *How can I get into a different IT career road as the one I am currently on? How can I get into the IT job of my dreams if I am currently doing IT x? How can I smartly plan ahead my future and escape the IT path that I am currently on if it's dying?* These questions has fused us to be a "A compass in the world of work".

# Initial Research
The initial research has proved that there is indeed a need for a solution. There are currently platforms, individuals and companies who serve the career counsellors role but **none of the players provide you with a view on the current IT market conditions in terms of a transparent future planning.**

# Market Research
The market research has strengthened our previous view. There is a strong need for transparent future planning and not just in IT... As a secondary school director in one of our expert interviews had stated:

*"We [teachers] are hesitant to give advice for young folks. The work they will do maybe don‚Äôt even exist today."*

This sums up perfectly the fast changing market conditions.

### Secondary Research
For our secondary research the best research contents are from the US and western EU. These may not be not as relevant for Hungary - where we wish to enter the market - however the research has proved our point that the "career concern" of gen Z is not exclusive to Hungary. Or as the Pew Research Center promptly summarized it: [On the Cusp of Adulthood and Facing an Uncertain Future](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2/)

### User Interviews
When we asked university students - our main target group - **an overwhelming amount of them said that they are unsure what they will do once they have finished studying.** Most of the students are choosing universities based on broad interest - which is absolutely fine - but most are still lacking a career "end point" (or god forbid start point) upon graduation.

### Expert Interviews
Most of the experts interviewed confirmed that there is a strong need for career advice and planning. However some has also raised their concerns in the subject. One expert particularly - let's call him B cause he wished to stay anonim - has told us that there seems to be a great need for career counseling however young folks (university students, high school students and young professionals) do not wish to pay the price for it. B had started a B2C career counseling business years ago (he is a successful business trainer himself), but this hadn't turned out to be a fruitful business. I believe if we look behind this story we really can see that this seemingly empty "ocean" (in Hungary there is only a handful of successful career counsellors) of traditional career counseling is just waiting to be disrupted.

# Pretotyping
So we set out to build a pretotype to test our assumptions.

### Sketches
*What should be the layout of the website?*

The first sketches of the landing page.

### Design and Branding
*How should the product feel?*

The first two touch points were skill development in Diablo II:

and a game where a spark shows the way in the dark:

### Pretotype
Karriverzum‚Äôs first look. Click or tap anywhere on the page and the available interactions will light up in a flash:

### Testing
The initial testing showed very promising results. We tested the pretotype with a handful of IT students and Levente - currently doing his master in computer programming - has liked the idea (and the challenge) so much that he joined us on board as our developer. üôå

# Product Design
So we started doing the ‚Äúreal thing‚Äù!
