## Executive Summary
A web platform for IT career planning currently under development. 

Our first big hairy audacious goal is to provide **a live career map for IT university students and young IT professionals** where they can plan ahead their future in the world of IT.

<br />

## Core Problem
Let's imagine you are planning to leave human resources and start a career in Product Design. This may certainly sounds like an extreme case but for a second let's play with the thought that this is really happening...

> "Millions of people have left their jobs in search of more fulfilling roles with greater flexibility – it’s been called the Great Reshuffle." [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/02/great-reshuffle-jobs-market-resignation/)

To begin with your transition into Product Design, UX Design seems like a great place to start. 

*I overheard my friend Jill saying that Product Designers always starts as UX Designers and she is certainly a credible source, isn't she?*

So now you have some more questions to answer...

*What is UX Design exactly? And where should I begin my journey with that?* 

You google your questions and you realize that even though the field of UX Design is kind of new, but somehow it has already expanded into this vast place with myriad of opportunities. So you ask yourself even more questions...

*Should I work on information architecture? Or should I do UI Design? Or maybe should I become a UX expert, working solely with analytics?* 

These are *some* of the questions you have to answer to *start* walking on your journey. And we still haven't even talked about the education you might need to kickstart your career, nor about your portfolio, nor even touched long term career planning just to name a few emerging problems you will need to deal with.

There has to be a better way to plan smartly one of the most important aspect of one's life: work.

<br />

## Solution
The core problem sparked our interest and we begin to work on a solution which would enable to plan one's course of work in short and mid term. 

*How can I get into a different IT career road as the one I am currently on?*

*How can I get into the IT job of my dreams if I am currently doing IT x?*

*How can I smartly plan ahead my future and escape the IT path that I am currently on if it's dying?* 

These are some important questions that has fused us to be a:

<br />

## Initial Research
The initial research has proved that there is indeed a need for an IT career planning solution. 

There are currently platforms, individuals and companies who serve the career counsellors role but **none of the players provide you with a view on the current IT market conditions in terms of a transparent future planning.**

<br />

## Market Research
As a secondary school director in one of our expert interviews had promptly stated:

> "In most cases, students will go on to do jobs that do not even exist today."

This sums up perfectly the current fast changing market conditions. For the full market research please browse the LINK below.

<br />

### Secondary Research
As much smarter people have said before us, Gen Z is the latest generation to "just barely" enter the workforce. So there is limited research available on this cohort, and of limited quality. 

> "All research around Gen Z currently focuses on students, making it challenging to predict their job-related behavior." [Emerald inside](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/EJTD-07-2020-0124/full/html). 

In addition, our research typically relies on Western research, so Gen Z in Hungary may be more nuanced than this. 

**That said, we can say that Generation Z is:**
* Hypercognitive
* Hybrid
* Generalist
* Individualist
* Independent
* And most importantly **career-oriented** (success-oriented)

**In order of importance to them in terms of career choice:**
1. Money
2. Purpose
3. Work-life balance
4. More human (e.g.: the job role is focusing on human interactions)

**And their biggest challenges are:**
* What career are you interested in?
* How can I tell what I'm good at or bad at?
* Anxiety

<br />

### User Interviews
**Among the interviewed subjects (university students), there is a typical uncertainty surrounding the choice of "profession”.** 

There is a demand for a medium-term commitment (3-5 years) to a career choice, but in the absence of an adequate toolbox, most students plan for the short term (1-2 years). 

The strategy of choosing a university that broadly covers their interests, but without a concrete idea of where they want to "end up", was typical of the subjects. The choice of career path is perhaps more crystallised towards the end of university. 

Another typical strategy is to study "even further" as a problem-solving tool to answer the career choice. E.g.: after a bachelor's degree, to do a Master's degree or even to start a completely different bachelor's degree. The experience gained can thus be increased within the academy.

Students may need support in choosing a career. The question remains whether the information on available careers can sufficiently meet this need.

Check out our ➡️ [User interviews_HU](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AVnQ09_-wY-R9FBRh0-oFRI1Ams8g4Dpig2bvfza4TQ/edit?usp=sharing)

<br />

### Expert Interviews
**The consensus among respondents is that career guidance in the traditional sense is bleeding from several wounds. Unpreparedness in public education, lack of interest on the part of students and under-informed guidance counsellors all contribute to poor choices career choices.**

Where parents are not aware of the labour market, students mostly turn to their teachers, who are often unable to provide adequate assistance, as few of them are qualified to do so. Therefore, they often start with the fact that what the child is good at is what the child should do, which is clearly wrong.

**Emerging questions after the interviews:**
* Is there a need today for young people to be helped in their career choices?
    * For those who do have a need, what tools do they use to find their way and how do they relate to them (e.g.: is felvi.hu satisfying)?
        * Which of the commonly used tools are effective?
* Is there a "solvent" demand for pathfinding assistance?
    * Who is willing to pay for this information (e.g. parents, schools, school districts, state, etc.)?
* How much demand is there for self-awareness tests (e.g. career guidance tests, personality tests)?
    * Is testing necessary to promote graduate students' career choices in a meaningful way? (testing could be e.g.: personality, IQ, soft skill, value, interest, etc.) - An important question is whether Karriverzum should be a browser interface to be explored or a more "directional" system.
* What help do students get to make career choices in secondary schools?
* Are people about to graduate interested in what the job market looks like, or are they just deciding where to go to school?
* What are students' feelings about career choices?
* How do students feel about career guidance in the classical sense? (Tens of thousands of forints to sit down with a professional for a few sessions)

## Pretotyping
We follow an agile methodology during the creation process (which often clashes with our team's need for perfection), and so in a hindsight we follow the following "recipe": 

> research, create, analyze, iterate and repeat

<br />

### High Level Sitemap
The first version of Karriverzum's sitemap:

<br />

### Design and Branding
The first two touch points for the feeling and the world we want to create are two very specific game element.

Skill development in Diablo II (famously known as "skill tree"):

and Unravel Two's spark (a spark which shows the way in the dark):

### Pretotype
Long and behold Karriverzum’s first look (without design just plain old stockphotos so you won't get terrified of wireframes):

### Testing
We tested the pretotype with a handful of IT students and Levente - currently doing his master in computer programming - has liked the idea (and the challenge) so much that he joined us on board as our developer. 🙌

<br />

## Product Design
So we started doing the “real thing”!
