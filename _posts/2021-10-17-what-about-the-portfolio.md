## Why UX design?

Why the urge is to lend a job in UX design? I believe it encompasses all the different aspects I love. People and Systems. Costumer-centeredness and Technology. Design and Usability just to name a few...

## Why you should hire me?

Because I am an extremely motivated young professional eager find my niche, grow and give value to the greater community.

And so why am I keep putting the portfolio in ""? It's because this is not a portfolio. It's more like a showcase of skills and knowledge I had amassed in my short years as a professional. The expereinces which are closely linked to the field of UX design.

Skills! 5 key competencies struck out for me, when it comes to UX design. And these 5 skills are:
